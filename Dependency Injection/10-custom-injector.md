# How can you use a custom injector in Angular?

To use a custom injector in Angular, you can create a new instance of the Injector class and configure it with the desired providers.

Here are the general steps to create and use a custom injector:

1. Create a new instance of the Injector class, passing in an array of provider objects.
2. Define the provider objects that correspond to the dependencies you want to inject. You can use either the provide function or an object with a provide property to define a provider.
3. Optionally, you can specify additional configuration options for each provider using the useClass, useValue, or useFactory properties.
3. Use the get method of the custom injector instance to retrieve an instance of the desired class or service.

Here is an example of how to create and use a custom injector:

```typescript
import { Injector } from '@angular/core';

class CustomService {
  constructor() {}
  
  greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }
}

const customInjector = Injector.create({
  providers: [
    { provide: CustomService, useClass: CustomService, deps: [] }
  ]
});

const customService = customInjector.get(CustomService);

console.log(customService.greet('John')); // Output: Hello, John!
```

In this example, we created a custom injector using the Injector.create method and passed in an array of providers that includes the CustomService class. We used the useClass property to specify that the CustomService class should be used to resolve the dependency. Finally, we retrieved an instance of the CustomService class using the get method of the custom injector and called the greet method on it.
