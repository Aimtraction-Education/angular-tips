# How can you use the ReflectiveInjector class in Angular?

The `ReflectiveInjector` class in Angular is used to instantiate and provide dependencies for a given component or service. It is an advanced API that allows developers to create their own injector instances and specify the dependencies that should be provided to a component or service.

To use the `ReflectiveInjector` class, you first need to create an instance of it by calling the static `resolveAndCreate` method, which takes an array of providers as its argument. These providers can be either class-based providers, factory functions, or value providers.

Once you have created an instance of the `ReflectiveInjector`, you can use the `get` method to retrieve an instance of a component or service. The `get` method takes the token of the component or service as its argument and returns an instance of that component or service.

Here is an example of how to use the `ReflectiveInjector` class:

## Example 1

```typescript
import { ReflectiveInjector } from '@angular/core';

class MyService {
  constructor(private value: string) {}

  getValue() {
    return this.value;
  }
}

const injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([
  { provide: 'value', useValue: 'Hello World!' },
  { provide: MyService, useClass: MyService, deps: ['value'] }
]);

const myService = injector.get(MyService);
console.log(myService.getValue()); // output: Hello World!
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `ReflectiveInjector` class and provide it with two providers: a value provider that provides the string 'Hello World!', and a class-based provider that provides an instance of the `MyService` class, which has a constructor parameter that depends on the 'value' token.

We then retrieve an instance of the `MyService` class from the injector and call its `getValue` method to output the string 'Hello World!' to the console.

The `ReflectiveInjector` class provides an alternative way to work with Angular's dependency injection system, allowing for more advanced use cases and greater flexibility in configuring dependencies.

##Example 2

```typescript
import { ReflectiveInjector } from '@angular/core';

class UserService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getUsers() {
    return this.http.get('/api/users');
  }
}

class AppComponent {
  private userService: UserService;

  constructor() {
    // create an injector with the required dependencies
    const injector = ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([HttpClient]);

    // get an instance of the UserService with the injector
    this.userService = injector.get(UserService);
  }

  getUsers() {
    this.userService.getUsers().subscribe((users) => {
      console.log(users);
    });
  }
}
```
In this example, we have a `UserService` class that has a dependency on the `HttpClient` class. In the `AppComponent` class, we use `ReflectiveInjector` to create an injector with the `HttpClient` dependency, and then we use that injector to get an instance of the `UserService` class. We can then call methods on the `UserService` instance, and it will automatically have access to the `HttpClient` dependency.
